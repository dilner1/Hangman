## bugs
Problem: When guessing a letter lives would be taken off depending on number of letters in word. This would happen even if one letter was guessed correctly.
Cause: Was checking each letter in word if it matched with the guess using 'for letter in word: if guess == letter:'
Resolution: Change function to check if guess was in word rather than checked every letter
